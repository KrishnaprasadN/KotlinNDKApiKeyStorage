# Android Kotlin NDK Api Key Storage
Kotlin Android app which demonstrates the storing of the api key in cpp file, which we access via Kotlin object. This is one of the secure way to store your api key. NDK compiles the C++ file to .so file. .so file contains binary numbers, which makes the hacker's life bit difficult to get back the actual api key.
